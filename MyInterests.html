							<h2>Social Work</h2>
							<p>‘Service to Society’ is a phrase I firmly stand by. I strongly empathize with the less fortunate and I try my best to help out despite my limited resources. I spent the summer of 2012 volunteering at a hospital – Telerad RxDx in Bangalore and assisting in patient care. I’ve also raised thousands of rupees in multiple Help Age India fundraisers. I’ve always contributed to Hamsadhwani, a school for children with disabilities, not only through money but also through friendship. As a regular visitor, I’ve made several friends there and spend my time playing cricket with them or just hanging out with them. For my 17th birthday, I funded an impoverished person’s cataract surgery with my own birthday money and that was one of my proudest moments. It may seem small and insignificant to most people but it is so much more than that to me.</p>

							<h2>Leadership</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Being tasked with the role of a ‘leader’ has never seemed daunting to me. I was elected as the School Prefect in 10th grade in Sishu Griha High School and I was elected to the post of Model United Nations Association President in 12th grade in National Public School. Those two roles coupled with my years of being Class Prefect and such have left me with a lot of experience. Taking charge in the middle of chaos comes naturally to me and I am very proud to say that I have honed by leadership abilities significantly through my experiences in Student Government.</p>

							<h2>Music</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Music has been a core part of my life ever since my mother forced me to join Hindustani Classical Vocal music lessons back when I was eight. I’ve been learning vocal music ever since then and I passed the All India Hindustani Music Examination. But I didn’t let my learning curve end there. I went on to pen and compose my own single which I subsequently released on YouTube. It now has around 2000+ views. Other than that, I’ve participated and placed in multiple vocal music competitions and I was also one of the lead singers of a school band.</p>

							<h2>Theatre</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Theatre has always interested and excited me but it was never something I whole heartedly indulged in until I was 16 and I joined my school’s drama team. Being a part of the Dramatics Team has been an entertaining journey for me. Right from brainstorming ideas to writing a script to holding auditions and helping develop each actor’s personal skills. Theatre is a beautiful form of art and I’m seriously considering doing a minor in this field. I’ve placed and participated in several plays and that has really boosted up my confidence in my own abilities. </p>
