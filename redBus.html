							<h2>redBus.in</h2>

						<p>My four week long internship at redBus.in (now acquired by ibibo.com) taught me more than two years of school could. It was that internship that made me sure of my decision to pursue Computer Science. I joined the IT team there and developed a program in JAVA which would analyse their customer complaints, segregate them and escalate them based on severity. I automated it to make it execute every night and send out emails to the desired persons consisting of the status of the complaints while also logging the details into their database. This internship helped me strengthen my JAVA, HTML and MySQL. Let me tell you that nothing will make you feel happier than calling up your old boss and having him tell you that your code is still in use even after leaving.</p>
