							<h2>Traveling</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I guess I’m super lucky to have parents who love traveling. I was bitten by the wanderlust bug when I was very young and ever since then I’ve traveled to around 24 countries. The number is approximate because I’m not sure if I should count places like Palestine as a country or not. I love exploring the culture, history and religion of different people across the world. There’s so much you can learn by just traveling and interacting with people who are very different from you. It’s also an amazing icebreaker. Most of the time, new people that I meet hail from a country that I’ve either been to or is on my list to visit and it’s incredibly fun and exciting to discuss these topics with different people.</p>

							<h2>Writing</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I love writing especially fiction. I get these random urges to write at awkward times. Once I woke up at 2 AM, fumbled for my phone, opened Tumblr and wrote “The Yngonic Maid” as my blog title and followed it up with the most ridiculous story I’ve ever come up with and that’s saying something. But apart from maintaining a tumblr blog, I also write fan fiction and I’m currently in the process of my second novel. (The first was one was written when I was 11 and is really not worth publishing.) In 2011 I was chosen by my school to attend a Time NIE, Time of India summer camp journalism session after which I was made the Brand Ambassador to my school for Times NIE. I also won the award for Most Number of Articles Sent In. I also used to have a recurring travel column in the paper.</p>
