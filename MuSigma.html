							<h2>Mu Sigma Private Limited</h2>

						<p>I did a four week long internships at Mu Sigma during the summer of 2014. It was really interesting and educational. I was assigned to the Products Team where I got to work on redesigning the GUI of one of their products and documenting it thoroughly. The internship also allowed me to gain vital skills like how to make and give professional presentations. I was also introduced to the basics of JavaScript and D3.js.</p>
